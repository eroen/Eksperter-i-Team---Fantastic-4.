\section{Different cultural backgrounds}
In a group with individuals from different countries it is important to take into consideration that there are a lot of different cultural aspects and that it is important to learn a little bit about each other when working so close together. The only knowledge about the culture and persona of the team has so far been learned during the check- in activities on Wednesday mornings. An example of the cultural differences was discovered during a check-in activity about our favorite colors on February 9. Arash said his favorite color was green and Victor later told us that green is associated with infidelity in his country. If a wife cheats on her husband, they will say he is wearing a green hat. Arash replied that they have the same expression in Iran only they use the color red. The Norwegians in the group had no recollection of a smiliar expression used in Norway. %In accordance with Scwartz ground rule nr 2 this is a very important part of the process, since not only the technological background is important when making decisions. Knowledge about other group members could lead to a quicker decisionmaking process since it probably would cause less misunderstandings. This also made clear later in the semester.

\section{The situation}
On the February 9 we violated one of Schwartz ground rules for effective teamwork. Talk openly about potentially hard or uncomfortable issues, so called undiscussable issues. This happened during a discussion about the project. Arash drew a schematic of the project and talked mainly about his part in the project, signal processing. A couple of days later there was posted a note on its learning from Andreas that he was sick of Arash not including his part in the project. Arash replied that he was very surprised when reading the note. The next meeting was as usual on Wednesday at 9 and we were not sure how the atmosphere in the group would be due to the posts. After the mandatory activities we decided to talk openly about the problems in the group and let both Andreas and Arash explain their side of the story, which solved the conflict. Conflict in a group is not necessary a negative thing as long as we turn it into an experience we can learn something from and use it to improve the co-operation in the team. 

\section{Telephone list}
When visiting the EMG lab the team got separated into two groups. The first group, Kristine and Arash, first returned to the classroom in the basement and waited for the other three. After a while we went looking for them but could not find them. Kristine returned to the room in the basement and found the rest of the group, but now Arash was not there. To avoid this kind of confusions in the future we decided to make a telephone list so it will be easier to reach the others if needed.

\section{EMG equipment}
The team had a few difficulties with using the EMG equipment and could retrieve the signal two weeks after the plan. This was due to faulty equipment. The first time the power supply of the computer was broken and had to be handed in for repair and the second time the computer was back from repair but lacked the necessary software for signal acquisition. This led to some frustration in the group and we felt that the progress of the project was going to slow. The delay with the EMG signal resulted in a slight change in the project, this was to prevent the group from lacking work and produced a task that was a bit different in the signal acquistion part but where the signal prosessing would be almost the same.

\section{Group form}
During the meeting on February 02 the group was supposed to fill out a form concerning the dynamics in the group. It was clear that there were some disagreements aspecially regarding the communication between the members and some meant that the group lacked a clear goal. After a quick discussion the group stated that the reason the answers was different, at least regarding the goals for the project, was that the goals have changed a bit along the way since there was a change from just studying EMG to including AMG as well. This made at least the part for Erik and Kristine a bit different since the signal used no longer is a electric signal but a acoustic signal. The group also decided to continue with both projects in parallel to make sure that all group memebers have something to do at all times. And if one of the goals regarding the EMG or AMG will not be able to be finished then the group have a back up plan. Although all the group members have decided to try to finish both parts since AMG is a newer research. The largest deviation about the communication was between Arash and the rest of the group and like he presented in his group log contribution that week: "I thought the answers to them should be better!" A reason for this is perhaps that he is one of the parts in most of the discussions where the communication fails. This was later brought up at the log feed-back meeting with the student assistants and after some dicsussion around the subject the group decided to be better at explaining the views, especially regarding the project. %And that the reason for these breaks in communication is perhaps due to a different technological background and the fact that the English is slightly different in pronunciation in the different countries and the fact that everyone in our group most communicate in their second language.

\section{Project}
When performing the signal aquisition, goal 1 of the EMG part, there were four of five members on the EMG lab. Erik had experience with LabView and therefore he was chosen to supervise the signal aquisition. The others in the group watched him work for the most of the time and although this was not the most efficient work method, this is an important part of the project and it is therefore important to know most of the details regarding the different parts of the project.
